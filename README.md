FaucetRPC
=========

This is a a remote control and payout script for the MultiFaucet PHP script.  Still in it's early stages but fully functional for paying out and refilling the faucet via RPC.

- Copy sample-faucet.conf.php and sample-wallet.conf.php as faucet.conf.php and wallet.conf.php.
- Edit each file (look at notes inside the sample files)
- Setup your Cron job (see Cron.txt for an example)
- Do a test run
